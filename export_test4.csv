Three great powers shaped the Muslim world then: the Ottomans in the west, the Safavids in Persia, and the Mughals here in Hindustan. At their height they ruled from Kabul to Bengal, from the mountains to the seas. They built cities of marble and gardens of light. Their court was a theatre of poetry, music, and power. Even the British, centuries later, called themselves heirs of the Great Mogul. Today, every Independence Day, India’s leader still speaks from their Red Fort in Delhi — a quiet echo of that golden throne.",,,"{""chapterId"": ""test4"", ""createdAt"": ""2025-11-15T15:25:39.723845Z"", ""imageDesc"": """", ""imageURL"": """", ""text"": ""Once, long before the Taj Mahal, India was ruled by the Mughals — the most dazzling empire of its age.

test4::6,0.0,test4,"Picture Shah Jahan’s court in 1628. The emperor sits beneath the Peacock Throne, diamonds catching the lamplight. Around him stand his nobles in two perfect rows — a living mirror called qarina. Behind the emperor hangs a golden chain. It runs from his balcony to the courtyard below. Any common person could ring it to seek justice. At the emperor’s feet, artists paint lions and lambs together — symbols of power and peace. This was how Shah Jahan wished the world to see him: as ruler and sage, strong yet merciful, holding both sword and prayer in one hand.",,,"{""chapterId"": ""test4"", ""createdAt"": ""2025-11-15T15:25:40.833810Z"", ""imageDesc"": """", ""imageURL"": """", ""text"": ""Picture Shah Jahan’s court in 1628.

When Mumtaz Mahal left the world, Shah Jahan vowed to build a resting place worthy of paradise. They called her Mumtaz Mahal, the Chosen One of the Palace. By the river Yamuna (yuh-MOO-nah), her tomb rose like a crown. We call it the Taj Mahal. This is not only love carved in stone.
